# satiety-bot-remake
A kind of bot for GTA:SA:MP

Before using the script - check whether all dependencies are set.
Activation - send "//isb" command into chat. Activation command makes imgui window either appear or disappear (if it was active).
If you want to reload script for some reason - send "//isb_r" command into chat.

All the settings are shortly described in an imgui window. Settings are saved in "..\moonloader\config\sbot-lua.ini", so you don't have
to set up your settings every time the script is reloaded.
